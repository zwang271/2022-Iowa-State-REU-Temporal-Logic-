# WEST mLTL Truth Table Generator

The WEST mLTL Truth Table Generator is a program that parses well-formed mLTL formulas and outputs the structure of the computations of these formulas and their substrings. Our recursive algorithm is based on the regular expressions of mLTL operators and runs with approximately doubly exponential space and time complexity.

## Installation


## Grammar

Upon compiling our main.cpp file, uses will be prompted:
```
Please enter a MLTL formula.
```
